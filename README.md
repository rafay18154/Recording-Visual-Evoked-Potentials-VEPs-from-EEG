# Recording-Visual-Evoked-Potentials-VEPs-from-EEG-get-Ocular-Artifact-Detection-Using-Filtering-Methods
Visual Evoked Potentials are a type of brain signal related to visual system input and recorded over the occipital lobe using EEG recordings.If you look at the EEG signal you will not see these VEP responses.  These responses are hindered by the EEG signal and must be enhanced by synchronous averaging. The small VEP responses are embedded in the EEG and requires carefully signal manipulations to observe the VEP signals Since VEP signals are originated with a constant stimulation sequences, synchronously averaging the whole EEG signal with blocks of the stimulation filter size yields the VEP response alone. In the EEg recordings there are undesired signals or noise that come from different sources , external sources such as powerlines, electromagnetic fields, and internal sources such as EMG, EKG activities, motion artifacts, eye movements and eye blinks and so on. In this mini project, you are supposed to detect the eye blinks in the EEG signal.
